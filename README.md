# Deven-Web
A simple program, featuring a browser: HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Python

Order:

1. Make the HTML (which is your home page for your browser): (Simple Website.html, format.css, forgot pass.html)
2. Make the offline game playable on your browser: (flappy bird.html)
3. Make the browser: (browser.py)
4. [optional] Make the program that operates and uses your browser: (startup.py)

Some notes:

- You can change the browser however you want, change the images, layout, etc. What I've done is just an example.

- To get the PyQt5 libraries: Follow these steps.
  win + r,
  type in cmd,
  in the command prompt type in pip install pyqt5

- For the calendar in the HTML, you will need to update it everyday. Line 294.

- You will need to change these parts in browser.py to your own file location: Line 13 and Line 54

- Download images along with the source code.
  
- You don't need to do the startup.py part, startup.py is a simple OS like program that uses the browser and is not required for browser.py to run.
